# project-orbital-mechanics
Project for the exam of Orbital Mechanics of the Master of Science programme in Space Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, Academic Year 2019/2020.

The project is composed of two assignments. In the first assignment, the design of an interplanetary transfer from Neptune to Earth with an intermediate flyby at Mars is performed. The design is carried out considering the total deltaV as the only figure of merit for the selection of the final trajectory. Two algorithms are used for the minimization of the total mission cost: a grid search algorithm and a genetic algorithm. In the second assignment, the analysis of the orbit of a satellite around the Earth is performed. The orbit is propagated using two different integration methods considering Earth oblateness (J2) and drag perturbations, the satellite's ground track is estimated, a frequency analysis on the orbital elements is performed and the implemented model is compared with the results from the NASA JPL HORIZONS ephemeris computation service.
